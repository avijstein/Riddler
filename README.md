# The Riddler

This is a collection of solutions to FiveThirtyEight's Riddler puzzles. These puzzles are fun on their own, and great jumping off points to exploring interesting challenges.

Includes material from:
* Maze (from 18 Oct 2019)
* Territory Strings (from 13 Sept 2019)

### Maze
* This is really my first dive into graph trees, and I still have no idea what I'm doing. Still, a lot of the Riddler challenges are based on graph theory, so this seems like as good a time as any to learn.

### Territory Strings
* In other challenges I've focused on finding the exact solution and solving more general problems. Today, I'm focusing on sampling enough times to approximate it. I didn't want to tangle with graph trees again, so I'm trying a sample/resample approach.
* I'm also interested in exploring mapping options here.
