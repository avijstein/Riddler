# The Riddler

This is a collection of solutions to FiveThirtyEight's Riddler puzzles. These puzzles are fun on their own, and great jumping off points to exploring interesting challenges.

Includes material from:
* Maze (from 18 Oct 2019)
* Territory Strings (from 13 Sept 2019)

### Territory Strings
* In other challenges I've focused on finding the exact solution and solving more general problems. Today, I'm focusing on sampling enough times to approximate it. I didn't want to tangle with graph trees again, so I'm trying a sample/resample approach.
* I'm also interested in exploring mapping options here.
